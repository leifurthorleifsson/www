Jethro is pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University under the guidance of Dr. Leifur Leifsson. He received a Master's degree in Applied Mechanics from the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Vellore Institute of Technology in India. His research is focused on the development and application of multifidelity machine learning models for flow field prediction and aerodynamic shape optimization. He has also worked on problems involving global sensitivity analysis as well as uncertainty quantification and propagation.
