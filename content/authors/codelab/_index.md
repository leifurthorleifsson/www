Welcome to the COmputational DEsign Laboratory (CODE Lab) at the [School of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE),
[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) led by [Prof. Leifur Thor Leifsson](/authors/leifur).

Our research focuses on advancing fundamental computational methods for optimal design and uncertainty quantification of aerospace systems. 

Current applicatons include aerodynamic modeling and shape optimization, microwave device design optimization, uq of nondestructive testing systems, satellite system program cost modeling and analysis, and food-water-energy system modeling. 

We are grateful for the support from the following organizations:
