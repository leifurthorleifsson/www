Nazareen received her undergraduate degree in mechatronics engineering from Anna University in India, and a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from Iowa State University. She is pursuing her Doctor of Philosophy in aerospace engineering at Iowa State University under the guidance of Prof. Leifsson. Her research is focused on finding parameters impacting the acquisition cost of complex systems using model-based systems engineering. Her research also involves Bayesian parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification.
